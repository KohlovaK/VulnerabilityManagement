<h1>Vulnerability Management - Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I created Vulnerability Management with Nessus Essentials and VMware Workstation Player 17. I installed there deprecated software and was running scans against my virtual machine using different scenarios for scans (basic scan, scan with credentials, scan for deprecated software). Then I went through these scans and observed what happened.
<br />

<h2>Tutorial from:</h2>
For this project, I followed the Vulnerability Management tutorial from Josh Madakor, the whole tutorial is available on his Youtube channel:

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>
- <b>VMware Workstation Player 17</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<b>1. Installing necessary software:</b> <br/>
First, I installed all the necessary software for this project, which are:

- <b><a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials">Nessus Essentials</a></b>
- <b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VMware Workstation Player 17</a></b>
- <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Windows 10 ISO (that allows installing Windows 10 on a virtual machine)</a></b>

<b>2. Setting up virtual machine in VMware:</b> <br/>
In VMware, I created a new virtual machine. The location for the installer was set to be the same as for Windows 10 ISO. I changed the network adapter to "Bridged" (which put the VM on the same network as my physical computer so it is easier for Nessus implementation to communicate with the VM). Then Windows 10 is installed on the VM.

<b>3. Ensuring connectivity with VM:</b> <br/>
I turned off the Windows firewall on VM - on all Domain, Private, and Public profiles. After this, I was able to ping the IP address of the VM.

<b>4. Basic Scan:</b> <br/>
In Nessus, I created a new scan - Basic Network Scan. In Targets, I pasted the IP address of my VM.

Then I run the created scan.

When the scan is launched, after clicking on it, I can see the results. So far we can just see medium vulnerabilities and few infos. As for this scan credentials were not used, we cannot see that much what could be vulnerable.

Here, we can see the found vulnerabilities:

After clicking on the specific one, we can see the description of the vulnerability and reccomended solution. Infos do not have to be vulnerabilities in all cases, but something we should be aware of.

<b>5. Credentialed Scan:</b> <br/>
This time, I entered my credentials (username and password I made for the VM) for the scan, so it can go to the VM more deeply, and looks through the registry, file system, etc. This allows us to discover more vulnerabilities.
