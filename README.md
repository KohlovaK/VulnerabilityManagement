<h1>Vulnerability Management - Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I created Vulnerability Management with Nessus Essentials and VMware Workstation Player 17. I installed there deprecated software and was running scans against my virtual machine using different scenarios for scans (basic scan, scan with credentials, scan for deprecated software). Then I went through these scans and observed what happened.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>
- <b>VMware Workstation Player 17</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<b>1. Installing necessary software:</b> <br/>
First, I installed all the necessary software for this project, which are:

- <b><a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials">Nessus Essentials</a></b>
- <b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VMware Workstation Player 17</a></b>
- <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Windows 10 ISO (that allows installing Windows 10 on a virtual machine)</a></b>

<b>2. Setting up virtual machine in VMware:</b> <br/>
In VMware, I created a new virtual machine. The location for the installer was set to be the same as for Windows 10 ISO. I changed the network adapter to "Bridged" (which put the VM on the same network as my physical computer so it is easier for Nessus implementation to communicate with the VM)
