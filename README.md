<h1>Vulnerability Management - Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I created Vulnerability Management with Nessus Essentials and VMware Workstation Player 17. I installed there deprecated software and was running scans against my virtual machine using different scenarios for scans (basic scan, scan with credentials, scan for deprecated software). Then I went through these scans, observed what happened, and tried to solve some issues.
<br />
In this project, I learned how it is important to have all software up to date to significantly decrease the number of potentional vulnerabilities.
<br />

<h2>Tutorial from:</h2>
For this project, I followed the Vulnerability Management tutorial from Josh Madakor, the whole tutorial is available on his Youtube channel: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT6Px9zJM3s&ab_channel=JoshMadakor-Tech%2CEducation%2CCareer">Vulnerability Management Tutorial</a>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>
- <b>VMware Workstation Player 17</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<b>1. Installing necessary software:</b> <br/>
First, I installed all the necessary software for this project, which are:

- <b><a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials">Nessus Essentials</a></b>
- <b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VMware Workstation Player 17</a></b>
- <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Windows 10 ISO (that allows installing Windows 10 on a virtual machine)</a></b>

<b>2. Setting up virtual machine in VMware:</b> <br/>
In VMware, I created a new virtual machine. The location for the installer was set to be the same as for Windows 10 ISO. I changed the network adapter to "Bridged" (which put the VM on the same network as my physical computer so it is easier for Nessus implementation to communicate with the VM). Then Windows 10 is installed on the VM.

<b>3. Ensuring connectivity with VM:</b> <br/>
I turned off the Windows firewall on VM - on all Domain, Private, and Public profiles. After this, I was able to ping the IP address of the VM.

<b>4. Basic Scan:</b> <br/>
In Nessus, I created a new scan - Basic Network Scan. In Targets, I pasted the IP address of my VM.

Then I run the created scan.

When the scan is launched, after clicking on it, I can see the results. So far we can just see medium vulnerabilities and few infos. As for this scan credentials were not used, we cannot see that much of what could be vulnerable.

Here, we can see the found vulnerabilities:

After clicking on the specific one, we can see the description of the vulnerability and recommended solution. Infos do not have to be vulnerabilities in all cases, but something we should be aware of.

<b>5. Credentialed Scan:</b> <br/>
This time, I entered my credentials (username and password I made for the VM) for the scan, so it can go to the VM more deeply, and looks through the registry, file system, etc. This allows us to discover more vulnerabilities.
To do the scan with credentials, I first enabled remote registry in Services on VM. This allows the scanner to connect to this remote registry. Then I enabled file and printer sharing in Advanced sharing settings. In User Account Control Settings I disabled notifications. Lastly, in Registry Editor I added a key which is supposed to allow the remote account to connect. After adding the key there I restarted the VM.

Then I edited the scan I made. I went to Configuration and pasted the credentials of my VM. After saving this I went back to my scans and run the scan again.

Now we can see more vulnerabilities and also critical and high ones. There is a big difference between credentialed and non-credentialed scans.

<b>6. Installing a deprecated software on my VM and running 3rd scan:</b> <br/>
In this step, I will install a deprecated Firefox on my VM. I installed the release 3.6.12. from this <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-US/">link</a>.
In Nessus, I launched the scan again without any modifications. After the scan run, we can see how the number of vulnerabilities drastically increased. Now we have a bunch of critical vulnerabilities.

Here we can see multiple vulnerabilities connected with the old version of Mozilla Firefox:

<img src="https://snipboard.io/JPmf7T.jpg" height="80%" width="80%" alt="new_scan"/>

In Remediations, Nessus suggested the obvious solution - "Upgrade to Mozilla Firefox version 113.0 or later".

<img src="https://snipboard.io/CjALev.jpg" height="80%" width="80%" alt="remediation_scan3"/>

So as a solution to these, we can uninstall Firefox completely or update it to the newest version.

<b>7. Remediating some vulnerabilities:</b> <br/>
Now I will try to fix some issues. I will uninstall Firefox from my VM and run Windows updates. After this, I run the scan again.

After fixing the most critical vulnerability and running the scan again, we can see that from 77 critical vulnerabilities we went to just one. And most of the foundings are just infos.

The further ivestigation: I checked the remaining critical vulnerability and we can see that Nessus detected unsupported Microsoft Internet Explorer version, so the next step here would be to either disable Internet Explorer on the virtual machine or to upgrade to the currently supported version.
